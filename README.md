# compiler
The Lexical analyzer is the first phase in compiler phases . In the lexical analyzer
generator we automatically construct a lexical analyzer from a regular expression
description of a set of tokens. construct a nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) for
the regular expressions, combine these NFAs together with a new starting state,
convert the resulting NFA to a DFA and minimize it .
